This project is aimed at "automatizing" the process of search for
asteroid in an image set provided by an observatory.

Let's suppose that observations have provided you with the following
set of observations:

How many moving objects do you dectect in this image? If your answer
is one, you are a good obsever. If it is more than one but less than
three you are well trained for this task.  But if you see 4 you are an
expert!

To see the answer follow [this
