This project is aimed at "automatizing" the process of search for
asteroid in image sets provided by observatories.

Let's suppose that a given observatory has provided you the following
set of observations (credit: PANSTARRS/[IASC](http://iasc.hsutx.edu/)):

How many moving objects do you dectect in this image? If your answer
is one, you are a good obsever. If it is more than one but less than
three you are well trained for this task.  But if you see 4 you are an
expert!

To see the answer follow [this
