# AIsteroid

This project is aimed at automatizing the process of searching for
asteroids in image sets provided by observatories.

Let's suppose for instance that you have the following set of
observations (credit:

How many moving objects do you dectect in this image? 

If your answer is one, you are a good obsever.  However, if you see
between 1 and 3 objects, you seem to have a trained eye.  But if you
see 4, probably you are a machine! (to see the actual number of moving
objects see the image in [this
